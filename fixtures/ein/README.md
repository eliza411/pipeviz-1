## Prototype fixtures
#### JSON that tells a story

This directory contains valid pipeviz JSON messages. The intention is that, when sent to a pipeviz daemon in filename lexical order, they simulate a realistic series of messages that a real pipeviz instance might receive, in the case of someone setting up pipeviz around some existing software/infrastructure.

This directory’s fixtures were the original set developed during early prototyping of pipeviz. They’re kept around mostly for posterity. They are valid, though they aren’t messages that any realistic producer could ever create.
